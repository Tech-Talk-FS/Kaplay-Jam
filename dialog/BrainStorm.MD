# Fallen Knight: Requiem of Honor

## Opening Scene

A knight awakens in a weathered sanctuary, his armor tarnished and crest obscured. Around his neck hangs a mysterious pendant bearing a fractured coat of arms. Faded tapestries line the walls, depicting great battles and fallen kingdoms. He remembers nothing of his past, only the weight of his sword and an innate sense of duty.

## Core Mystery

The protagonist discovers he was once a legendary knight commander who faced a terrible choice during a kingdom-threatening crisis. His actions that day led to a magical curse that stripped him of his identity. His essence - his honor, duty, and true nature - was scattered across three sacred locations representing the pillars of knighthood.

## Starting

In the depths of a castle dungeon, a figure awakens on a stone altar, surrounded by piles of shattered armor and broken swords. The room echoes with voices from the past as dim torchlight flickers against damp stone walls. Shadows shift, revealing skeletal figures rising from the dust around him. He has no memory of who he is, but the weight of the dungeon—and these ancient remains—suggests he is not a stranger here. Instinctively, he knows he must fight his way through these skeletal remnants and uncover the clues to the truth of his past.

### Banner:

Hanging on a cracked stone wall, an old banner bears the symbol of a kingdom he cannot yet recall. He feels a tug of loyalty, though he knows not to whom or why. The memory is faint, but it suggests he once served something greater.

In addition to the keys, the protagonist also comes across several chests scattered throughout the dungeon. Each chest contains an important item that helps him piece together more of his identity:
Knight's Oath Scroll: The chest contains an ancient, worn scroll that reveals the knightly oath he swore, solidifying his connection to the kingdom and his duty to protect the crown.
Royal Seal Ring: Another chest holds a seal ring, bearing the symbol of the kingdom's royal family. The moment he touches it, he recalls a time when this ring was a symbol of trust and authority, given to him by the monarch.
Broken Sword Hilt: In another chest, a broken sword hilt rests, its blade missing. Holding it sparks memories of battle, but also of loss. The sword once served as both weapon and symbol of the knight's honor, and the absence of the blade hints at a tragic event, perhaps the moment he lost his identity.
Strategic Map: Lastly, one chest holds a map, detailing battle plans and the kingdom's defenses. This map represents his strategic mind, hinting at his role as a military leader who combined his martial skills with tactical brilliance.

Silver Key and Gold Key: He finds two keys: one silver, one gold. The silver key feels cold and familiar in his hand, unlocking a memory of an oath. The gold key, warm to the touch, evokes a sense of reverence. Together, they hint at his bond to a royal house, perhaps even a personal responsibility to protect a figure of power.

After battling the skeletal guardians and uncovering the keys, the protagonist approaches a small, dimly lit chamber deeper within the dungeon. At the center of the room sits an old, tarnished candelabra, its candles long extinguished. Dust and cobwebs have gathered around it, a testament to the years of neglect.

While examining the room, the protagonist notices a faded inscription on the wall, partially obscured by the growing shadows. The inscription reads:
"Light the way, reclaim what was lost. The flame will guide the forgotten."

This triggers a sense of recognition. The room feels like a place of importance, and the candelabra seems central to unlocking the next piece of his memory. As the protagonist reflects on the inscription, he remembers flickers of images: a hall filled with light, a guard at the entrance, and a duty to protect something sacred.

It's once vibrant fabric now faded and torn. The sigil stands out even in its tattered state—a symbol of strength, courage, and protection. I kneel beside it, my fingers brushing the fabric, and a strange sense of recognition washes over me. This banner… it feels like it should mean something to me.

"I've seen this before," I think, though the memory doesn't fully form. "It feels familiar... like a symbol of something I was part of. But what? Why does it stir something deep inside?"

A symbol of courage. Was I once part of something that stood for that? This banner… it feels important, but I can't quite remember why. It feels like something I would have fought for, but I don't know why.

### The Silver Key:

Lying beside a worn stone pedestal, the silver key catches the light. Its simple yet elegant design is striking. As my hand closes around it, I can almost hear the sound of a heavy door opening in my mind, but no faces or places come to mind. It's just... a key.
"I know this key," I think. "But where does it fit? Was it for a room? A place I used to know? A door I had to lock or unlock?"
Something feels important about it, like it was part of a routine—a place where I went to retreat, perhaps, or a duty I had to fulfill. But the details are missing. All I know is that this key leads somewhere, and it's tied to my past in some way I can't yet understand.

### Additional Candelabra:

"I lit candles like this in the throne room," I think. "I prepared the space for ceremonies, for moments of reflection and devotion." A fleeting image comes to mind: me standing in the grand hall, lighting candles before a gathering of nobles and warriors alike.

The Chests (Knight’s Oath Scroll, Royal Seal Ring, and Broken Sword Hilt):
The chests hold their secrets. The first chest opens to reveal the knight's oath scroll—worn, yellowed parchment, the words barely legible. But as I read them, a strange sensation pulses through me. The words seem to echo in my mind, like something I've heard before…
"I swore this oath once," I think, reading the words again. "To protect, to serve, to defend... but protect whom? Serve what purpose?"
It's as if these words are something I was meant to live by, but I can't remember why or who I swore them to. This oath is tied to something important, but I'm not sure what.
The second chest holds the royal seal ring, a symbol of authority and trust. I slip it onto my finger and instantly feel the weight of something profound—like it marked me for a duty I was bound to fulfill. But what was that duty? What was I trusted with?
"A seal... this ring... it means something to me," I think, "but what? What did I protect, and who trusted me with it?"
Finally, the third chest reveals the broken sword hilt. The blade is gone, but the hilt feels familiar in my hand. I grip it, and the sensation of holding a weapon fills my mind—fighting in battle, standing tall. But who was I fighting for?
"This feels like mine," I think, "I wielded this sword before, but why is it broken? Where is the rest of it?"

### Final Realization:

The banner. The keys. The oath. The ring. The hilt. Each item… each discovery has led me here, to this moment, where everything suddenly makes sense.
I was a knight—a sworn protector of the kingdom, entrusted with sacred duties and an unbreakable vow. The banner was mine, the oath I took was real, and the ring marked my bond with the crown. The broken sword… the weapon I used to defend all that I held dear.
"I am a knight." The realization comes slowly, but it is undeniable. "I swore to defend, to protect. I was part of something greater than myself."

### The Gold Key:

The gold key is heavier than the silver one, and it feels as though it carries a significance beyond its appearance. As I turn it over in my hand, something stirs within me—an image of a hidden door, a secret chamber, perhaps? A place that holds secrets.
